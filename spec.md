# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the frontend UI to reflect a premium airline visual style (Qatar Airways-inspired), with refined typography, spacing, color accents, navigation, hero section, and scroll-driven workflow animations.

**Planned changes:**
- Increase section vertical padding (min 96px) and whitespace throughout for a spacious, luxurious feel
- Upgrade heading typography with refined font-weight and letter-spacing for an upscale editorial look
- Introduce a subtle gold/champagne accent color for decorative dividers and section separators
- Ensure all cards use consistent box-shadow depth and slightly increased border-radius
- Redesign the navbar to be slim and elegant with generous horizontal padding, refined uppercase/spaced nav link styling, a thin gold/light-grey bottom border, an active link indicator, and exactly four links (Live Entry, Member Management, Entry Logs, Security & System Status)
- Polish the hero section to fill the full viewport height using the lounge background image with a gradient overlay (dark bottom, lighter top), large bold headline (min 3.5rem), a professional tagline, a clean CTA button, and a subtle animated scroll-down chevron
- Add eyebrow/stage labels (e.g., "STAGE 01 — FACE DETECTION") above each workflow section heading
- Apply staggered fade-in + upward slide entrance animations to workflow section content elements

**User-visible outcome:** The application displays a cohesive, premium airline-grade visual design with an elegant navbar, a cinematic hero section, spacious gold-accented sections, and smoothly animated workflow stages that feel like a guided product walkthrough.
