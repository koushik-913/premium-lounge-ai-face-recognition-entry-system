  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements (REQ-13 through REQ-16) comprehensively. The premium airline visual design system, navbar redesign, hero section polish, and staggered workflow animations are all present. Only minor details warrant scrutiny.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Headline font size is at least 3.5rem on desktop",
      "reason": "The IntroductionSection uses clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4.5rem) for the headline. On smaller desktop viewports the 5vw value could fall below 3.5rem, and the clamp minimum of 2.5rem is also below the required 3.5rem minimum specified in the acceptance criteria.",

      "reason": "REQ-14 specifies the navbar should contain exactly four navigation links with no additional buttons and no visual clutter. Adding a system status indicator to the navbar was not requested and adds an element beyond the four nav links.",
